This includes utilizing all of the learning modalities, creating learning tools for yourself and others and finally teaching someone else.", content: "Why am I qualified to talk about this? I have a teaching certificate from the https://www.cde.state.co.us/, I am dyslexic and I have failed more than I have succeeded and never given up. I think the first point does not require explanation, unless to say that I also have 7 years of teaching experience. The second point, needs some explaining, as someone who is dyslexic, I have had to learn how to learn because just going to class and reading the material didn’t work. I had to really teach myself how to make the material stick, and developed learning strategies in order to survive and evidentially thrive in college (I went from struggling to get Bs and Cs in high school to graduating college with honors). Finally, a quote from Albert Einstein, “Failure and deprivation are the best educators and purifiers.”

Sometimes to learn something we are struggling with, we need to shift our perspective, and what I mean by this, is attack it from the different learning modalities. Those include visual, auditory, kinesthetic, among others and if you are interested, here is one interpretation from Concordia University in Portland on https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/learning-modalities-understanding-learning-styles-of-all-students/.

First, it would be helpful to know your primary learning style and take measures to use this knowledge on a regular basis, and in addition, supplement those efforts with the other styles when things are not clicking. For example, if you are auditory and you normally listen to podcasts to learn new things and the last one you heard didn’t make much sense, I recommend finding an article to read on the subject (visual) and then map it out or practice it (kinesthetic). Here are some more ideas: make charts, graphs, lists, watch someone else explain it on YouTube, create practice exercises that you would be willing to share and then make it into a project (podcast, blog post, build an app, presentation, etc.).

Finally, if you really want to master the skill or subject matter, teach it to someone else until you see their lightbulb become illuminated!", published: "28/1/2019")
